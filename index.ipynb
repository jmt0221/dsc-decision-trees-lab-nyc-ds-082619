    "Following the toy example we saw in the previous lesson, we'll now build a decision tree for a more complex dataset. This lab covers all major areas of standard machine learning practice , from data acquisition to evaluation of results. We'll continue to use the scikit-learn and pandas libraries to conduct this analysis, following the same structure we saw in the previous lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pandas to prepare the data for the scikit-learn decision tree algorithm\n",
    "- Train the classifier with a training dataset and evaluate performance using different measures\n",

This Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknotes! The notes were first digitized, followed by a numerical transformation using DSP techniques. The final set of engineered features are all continuous in nature, meaning that our dataset consists entirely of floats, with no strings to worry about. If you're curious about how the dataset was created, you can visit the UCI link listed above to learn about feature engineering in detail!\n",
